# Logic Circuits Project 

The development of this project is part of the digital logic design course at the Polytechnic University of Milan, and as a final examination, it is necessary for the bachelor's degree in computer engineering. The course was held by prof. William Fornaciari in the academic year 2021-2022.<br>
***Final score: 30/30 cum laude***

## Project specification
<p><em>The complete specification and design of the solution are fully described in the document in the deliverables folder, a brief description follows.</em></p>

<p>The goal of the project is to implement a convolutional encoder with rate of transmission 0.5. It is therefore a question of specifying a hardware component, described in VHDL, which interfaces with a memory.<br>
